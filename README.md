An Intrusion Detection System using Deep Neural Network's Back Propagation.
The Dataset was obtained from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity 2018 Dataset. The network was trained using a 4 layer DNN.
For more accuracy it is encouraged that the network is tested using more recent dataset, maybe 2020.
I couldn't use the recent dataset as it was too large for me to download (over 120Gb in size).
